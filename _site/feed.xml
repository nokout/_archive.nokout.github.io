        <title>I thought I must be dreaming.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I must be dreaming that
I thought I was awake,
For I was without question in
A most peculiar state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who was thinking I was dreaming
I was thinking in my sleep?
Was I awake while sleeping?
Oh, this was far too deep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or was I dreaming I was thinking
I was dreaming in the night?
And would I wake up tired or rested
Come the morning light?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarm beeped, and quickly I
Rolled off the rumpled bed,
Grateful for the clarity
That lit the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
